## Context

The user decided (2026-10-07, in conversation) to give the harness an
on-request security audit: a thin `/security-audit [scope]` command that
wraps a **vendored, unmodified** copy of Cloudflare's `security-audit` skill
(https://github.com/cloudflare/security-audit-skill, MIT), pinned to one
commit. The command is modelled on `/audit-mutations`: optional, above the
bar, never a gate, never part of the story loop; it writes an audit under
`docs/wiki/audits/` to `docs/wiki/audits/TEMPLATE.md`'s structure and files a
story per confirmed finding or cluster. It fixes nothing.

Three facts about this environment shape the command and are stated in it
rather than discovered by the next agent:

- **No subagent here can spawn a subagent.** Cloudflare's skill has a
  "parent" that launches hunters, critics and verifiers through the platform's
  Task tool. So the command runs **in the orchestrating session itself**, like
  `/plan-product`, not by delegating to one agent.
- **No OS-enforced sandbox.** The skill's own rule is that without one it
  executes no target code and keeps execution-dependent leads as
  `needs_validation`. The summary must say so.
- **Node cannot be assumed** (`rules.md`, "Portability"), and on this host it
  is not enough anyway: Cloudflare's `validate-findings.cjs` refuses to read
  any file on Windows (measured at PLANNED, see Contract C-7). "Validators not
  run" is therefore a normal outcome the command reports, never a failure.

`docs/wiki/architecture.md` does not exist in this repository (the harness
has no product architecture page; `/plan-story` step 1 is satisfied by
`CLAUDE.md`, `rules.md` and the two most recent stories, HARNESS-041 and
HARNESS-042). The id scheme is `HARNESS-NNN`, and 043 was free at creation.

**Type: `feature`, not `chore`.** `story-authoring` defines a chore as
"tooling or migrations with no behaviour change". This story adds a new
command - new behaviour a user invokes - and every criterion below can be
written as a failing test under RED before any file exists, so the chore's
one privilege (SCAFFOLD) is neither needed nor justified. The vendored
documents are the bulk of the diff by bytes, but a diff's byte count is not
the kind of work it is.

**Not split.** Vendoring, the command, the pin test and the refresh coverage
are one RED→GREEN cycle: four mechanical criteria, one new suite plus one row
in an existing one, and GREEN is a copy plus one ~50-line file. The one piece
that cannot be a test - the first trial run, which sets the budget default -
is a `## Deferred verifications` entry owned by GATES (DV-1), per the
dispatcher's recommendation. Splitting it off as a story of its own would
make a story whose only artifact is one number in one line.

**The gate that fails if this breaks** is the harness's own `selftest`,
which CI runs on every PR: the new `security-audit` suite (AC-1, AC-2, AC-4),
and the existing `reporting` and `shipped-docs` suites (AC-3). No
`required_gates` entry is needed.

## Acceptance criteria

<!-- Each AC is independently testable and phrased as observable behaviour.
     The Test Developer writes at least one failing test per AC. -->

- **AC-1 (the vendored skill is pinned, complete and unmodified)** — Given
  `.claude/skills/security-audit/`, when `bash scripts/selftest.sh
  security-audit` runs, then: (a) `UPSTREAM` exists and its first line names
  `cloudflare/security-audit-skill` and a 40-hex commit; (b) every path
  `UPSTREAM` lists exists and `git hash-object` of it equals the blob SHA
  listed (21 files: 20 skill files plus `LICENSE`; upstream's 22nd blob is its `README.md`, not vendored); (c) no file exists in the
  directory that `UPSTREAM` does not list, other than `UPSTREAM` itself.
  *Control:* with one byte of one listed file changed, or `LICENSE` emptied,
  the check prints exactly one line naming that file; with an extra file
  dropped in, one line naming it.
- **AC-2 (the command carries the harness-specific defaults and the honesty
  statements)** — Given `.claude/commands/security-audit.md`, when the suite
  reads it, then it finds, as the exact needles in Contract C-3: frontmatter
  `model: fable`; the default scope repo-wide; the default profile `quick`;
  a strict budget stated as a whole number of agent invocations; that it runs
  in the session and not in a subagent; hunters, critics and verifiers on
  `opus`; the three honesty statements (no OS-enforced sandbox so no target
  code runs and such leads stay `needs_validation`; "validators not run" when
  `node` is absent or the validator refuses; a clean run is "nothing found
  this run", never "clean"); that it is never a gate and not part of the
  story loop; the summary path `docs/wiki/audits/<scope>-<date>.md` written
  to `docs/wiki/audits/TEMPLATE.md`; and `new-story.sh` for findings.
  *Control:* a fixture copy with any one needle removed prints one line
  naming that needle.
- **AC-3 (the existing tree rules accept the new command)** — Given the new
  command file in the tree, when `bash scripts/selftest.sh reporting` and
  `bash scripts/selftest.sh shipped-docs` run, then both pass: `reporting`
  has a `security-audit|bash scripts/plan.sh after` row in its next-action
  table and the command's last paragraph carries ``rules.md``, "Reporting to
  the user" and that needle; `shipped-docs` finds every `docs/` path the
  command and the vendored skill name either shipped or declared written.
  *Control:* in RED the row exists and the command does not, so `reporting`
  is red with `.claude/commands/security-audit.md: is in the next-action
  table but does not exist`.
- **AC-4 (the refresh ships it)** — Given a fixture project with no
  `.claude/skills/security-audit/` and no `.claude/commands/security-audit.md`,
  when `bash scripts/refresh-harness.sh <this checkout>` runs in it, then the
  project has both, and AC-1's check over the project's copy of the skill
  directory prints nothing.
  *Control:* the same refresh from an upstream fixture lacking the directory
  leaves the project without it (the directory arrives from upstream, not
  from the script).

## Contract

<!-- Written by the Lead PO BEFORE RED, and AMENDABLE BY RED IN PLACE with a
     reason - GREEN then builds what the amended block says. -->

**Writes:** `.claude/commands/security-audit.md`, `.claude/skills/security-audit/UPSTREAM`, `.claude/skills/security-audit/LICENSE`, `.claude/skills/security-audit/*.md`, `.claude/skills/security-audit/*.cjs`, `.claude/skills/security-audit/report-schema.json`, `.claude/tests/security-audit.test.sh`, `.claude/tests/reporting.test.sh`, `.claude/tests/floors.conf`, `.claude/tests/selftest.test.sh`

Every path classifies as `harness` (`bash scripts/classify.sh` at PLANNED on
the command, `SKILL.md`, `LICENSE`, `report-schema.json`, both `.cjs` kinds:
all print `harness`), so the phase lock freezes none of them and
`check-boundaries.sh` counts none as source. The role boundary is honoured by
the agents: RED writes the four test files only; GREEN writes the command and
the vendored directory only. No existing export changes signature; there is
no caller list.

**RED may amend any block below in place, with a reason; GREEN builds what
the amended block says.**

- **C-1 The pinned upstream (settled - read out, never re-derived).**

  Upstream's `README.md` is **not** vendored (it describes the repository, not
  the skill; nothing instructs an agent to read it). `LICENSE` sits at
  upstream's root and is vendored into the skill directory because MIT
  requires the notice to travel with the copy. GREEN copies the 20 skill files
  flat into `.claude/skills/security-audit/` and sets the executable bit on
  the two `100755` validators with `git update-index --chmod=+x` (Windows
  `core.filemode` is false, so the bit does not come from the filesystem).
  The pin test checks content, not mode.
- **C-2 `.claude/skills/security-audit/UPSTREAM`** - the pin record, one
  file, extensionless so no skill-document scanner reads it as prose. Lines
  beginning `#` are comments; every other line is `<40 hex>` + two spaces +
  `<path relative to the directory>`. The first line is exactly

      # cloudflare/security-audit-skill @ c1c8a8c1471069fb0e188eeaff69b8e8db6564a8 (2026-09-14, MIT) - git blob SHAs; verify with `git hash-object`

  followed by one line per file of C-1 with the `skills/security-audit/`
  prefix dropped (so `LICENSE` and `SKILL.md` are siblings). Blob SHAs rather
  than sha256 because `git` is the one tool every harness host has, the
  values are upstream's own `ls-tree` so a later refresh is "compare against
  `git ls-tree -r <new commit>`", and `scripts/refresh-harness.sh` already
  judges files by `git hash-object`. A refresh of the vendored copy is: copy
  the files, regenerate this file from upstream's `ls-tree`, nothing else.
- **C-3 `.claude/commands/security-audit.md`** - about 50 lines
  (`audit-mutations.md` is 44), carrying only the harness-specific parts; all
  method stays in the skill's own files. The lines below are the needles the
  AC-2 test matches **exactly** (fixed strings, `grep -F`), so GREEN writes
  them byte for byte; everything around them is GREEN's prose.

  Frontmatter:

      description: Audit the code for security defects with Cloudflare's vendored security-audit skill (optional, on request)
      model: fable
      argument-hint: [path | subsystem | <ref>..<ref>]

  Body needles, one per fact, each on a line of its own or inside one line:

      Runs in the session that reads this file, not in a subagent
      Load `.claude/skills/security-audit/SKILL.md` in full audit mode
      Defaults: scope repo-wide; profile `quick`; budget 16 agent invocations (strict, provisional until HARNESS-043 DV-1)
      hunters, critics and verifiers: `subagent_type: general-purpose`, `model: opus`
      `research` agents: `subagent_type: Explore`, `model: opus`
      this environment has no OS-enforced sandbox, so the skill executes no target code; every finding is source-traced and anything that needs execution stays `needs_validation`
      validators not run
      nothing found this run
      never a gate, and nothing in the story loop runs it
      ~/security-audit-skill/<repo>/run-<N>
      docs/wiki/audits/<scope>-<date>.md
      docs/wiki/audits/TEMPLATE.md
      bash scripts/new-story.sh
      Report as `rules.md`, "Reporting to the user" says
      bash scripts/plan.sh after

  The AC-2 test is `grep -F` per needle over the whole file except the last
  two, which must be in the **last paragraph** (the `reporting` suite's AC-4
  checks that too; this suite only names the needle it missed). The budget
  needle is matched as the regex `budget [0-9]+ agent invocations \(strict`
  so DV-1 can set the number and drop the "provisional" clause without
  touching a test.

  *Amended in RED (test-developer, 2026-10-07).* The Defaults line is matched
  as the single ERE, within one line,
  ``Defaults: scope repo-wide; profile `quick`; budget [0-9]+ agent invocations \(strict``
  - the regex above with the line's fixed prefix in front of it. Reason: the
  regex alone leaves AC-2's "default scope repo-wide" and "default profile
  `quick`" with no needle at all, since the Defaults line is the only place
  C-3 states either; matching the budget clause alone would pass a command
  whose default profile is `standard`. The literal line above satisfies the
  ERE, and so does DV-1's edit (a different whole number, the "provisional"
  clause dropped), so GREEN writes the line exactly as given and DV-1 still
  touches no test. Every needle, fixed or regex, must sit **within one line**
  of the file. Semantics behind each line:
  - *scope*: the argument is a repository path (exists under the root), a
    subsystem name (free text the parent maps onto Cloudflare's coverage
    units and companion domains), or `<ref>..<ref>` (contains `..`, both
    sides `git rev-parse` cleanly) for the diff between two refs. Empty means
    the whole repository.
  - *profile `quick`*: Cloudflare's `quick` - one hunter wave, one final
    critic, one fresh verifier per candidate for both validation and final
    record verification. Their own default is `standard`; this harness
    defaults to `quick` because a run is on request and repeatable, and the
    skill's own measurement is that repeated runs find more than a longer
    single one.
  - *budget*: Cloudflare's strict total-agent budget, written into
    `run-metadata.json` as `budget`. The minimum a `quick` run can fund is 4
    reconnaissance + 1 critic + 1 verifier = 6; 16 is a provisional number
    chosen to leave about 10 hunter-or-verifier calls for a repository of
    this size. **DV-1 replaces it with a measured default**; until then the
    line says so.
  - *models*: the parent is the session (`fable`, the planning model per
    `models.conf`); every delegated agent is `opus`, the model judged
    stronger at reading code. Cloudflare's `general` role maps to
    `general-purpose` (hunters need Read/Grep/Glob/Bash and a scratch
    directory to write in); its `research` role maps to `Explore` (read-only
    by definition, which is what that role is). **No new agent definition**
    - see C-6.
  - *honesty (a)*: the exact sentence above; the summary's `## What was not
    checked` repeats it.
  - *honesty (b)*: before Phase 4 the command runs `command -v node`; if
    absent, or if either validator exits non-zero with a message that is not
    a schema error (on this host: C-7), the summary's `## Evidence` carries
    `validators not run: <first line of the validator's stderr, verbatim>`
    and the run continues. Never a failure, never silent.
  - *honesty (c)*: a run with no confirmed finding is reported as `nothing
    found this run`; the words "clean" or "secure" do not appear as a
    verdict. Cloudflare's README: one run found roughly half of what repeated
    runs found - read out, not re-measured.
  - *outputs*: raw run output stays in the skill's default directory outside
    the repository (`~/security-audit-skill/<repo>/run-<N>`); the harness
    writes one summary to `docs/wiki/audits/<scope>-<date>.md` in
    `TEMPLATE.md`'s structure, `<scope>` being `security` for a repo-wide run
    and `security-<slug of the argument>` otherwise, `<date>` `YYYY-MM-DD`;
    and one story per confirmed finding or cluster via `new-story.sh`, type
    `fix`. The summary's `## Decided` holds the verdicts, `## Evidence` the
    agents spent, wall-clock, validator status and the resolved model of
    every dispatch by name, `## What was not checked` the sandbox statement
    and the profile/scope/budget partiality.
  - **Spelling that `shipped-docs` requires:** the summary path must be
    written `docs/wiki/audits/<scope>-<date>.md`, the `audit-mutations`
    spelling. `shipped-docs.test.sh` extracts `docs/[A-Za-z0-9_./-]*` and
    skips a token ending in `/`; `docs/wiki/audits/security-<date>.md` would
    extract as `docs/wiki/audits/security-` and fail the real-tree assertion
    (measured at PLANNED by reading the extractor at `:66-67`).
- **C-4 `.claude/tests/security-audit.test.sh`** - a new suite, modelled on
  `shipped-docs.test.sh`: a function `vendor_problems <dir>` printing one
  `<path>: <reason>` line per violation of AC-1's (a)-(c) and nothing when
  clean, run over `$REPO_ROOT/.claude/skills/security-audit` (must print
  nothing) and over fixtures built compliant by construction with one defect
  each (must print exactly the one line); a function `command_problems
  <file>` doing the same for C-3's needles; and AC-4's refresh case using
  `refresh.test.sh`'s `new_project` shape with `UP="$REPO_ROOT"` (a git
  checkout on `main`, so the LOCAL check runs rather than reporting
  unknown). Portable awk and bash only; no `sha256sum` (absent on some
  hosts), `git hash-object` instead. Register it in `.claude/tests/floors.conf`
  AND the hand-copied table in `.claude/tests/selftest.test.sh` (`:525-560`)
  in the same commit, with the executed count read off its own summary line.

  *Amended in RED (test-developer, 2026-10-07), the refresh clause.*
  Measured by reading `scripts/refresh-harness.sh` (`:379-384`, `rm -rf` then
  `cp -r "$UP/.claude/$d"`) and confirmed by the AC-4 control, whose upstream
  is not a git repository at all and still delivers its skill: the refresh
  copies upstream's **working tree**, not its git objects. So AC-4 goes green
  on GREEN's uncommitted files; nothing has to be committed first. The LOCAL
  check (which does read the object store) only prints; the suite asserts
  nothing about it, so the parenthetical "on `main`, so the LOCAL check runs"
  is not load-bearing - on a CI checkout (detached, shallow) the refresh may
  print its "could not check" note instead, and the assertions are unchanged.
- **C-5 `.claude/tests/reporting.test.sh`** - one row added to `NEXT_TABLE`
  (`:59-69`): `security-audit|bash scripts/plan.sh after`. The fixture at
  `:313-375` generates a command per row, so no other edit is needed. In RED
  the real-tree assertion goes red with `is in the next-action table but
  does not exist`; that is AC-3's control.
- **C-6 No new agent definition, and why.** `rules.md`, "The model each agent
  runs on", wants the model a role runs on to be a fact of the harness
  rather than of the session. For Cloudflare's roles that fact is written in
  the command (C-3: `model: opus` on every dispatch) and recorded by name in
  the summary, which is the same two things `lead-po` does for every story
  dispatch. A `security-hunter.md` agent would add a third copy of prompts
  that already exist verbatim in `HUNTING.md` and
  `VALIDATION-AND-REPORTING.md`, and a copy is the one thing vendoring
  unmodified exists to avoid. `models.conf` is not touched: it plans story
  phases, and this command is not a story phase.
- **C-7 Baseline: Cloudflare's validators on this host (measured at PLANNED,
  2026-10-07, Windows 11, Git Bash, Node v24.19.0).** `node
  validate-findings.cjs <any path>` exits 1 with `Failed to read findings
  JSON: OS no-follow and nonblocking input protection is unavailable` -
  Windows has no `O_NOFOLLOW`, and the validator refuses rather than
  degrades. Its own `validate-findings.test.cjs`: 34 tests, 22 pass, 7 fail,
  5 skipped. `validate-coverage-ledger.test.cjs`: 31 tests, 24 pass, 0 fail,
  7 skipped. So on Windows the findings validator never runs and honesty
  constraint (b) is the normal path, which DV-1 will exercise. On Linux/macOS
  it is expected to run; not measured here. Nothing in this story changes
  Cloudflare's files to work around it (Out of scope).
- **C-8 Oracle partition.** Every criterion is **mechanical** - file
  presence, blob equality, fixed-string needles, a refresh's output tree -
  so RED pins exactly and leaves nothing open-ended. **Settled** values RED
  reads out and does not re-derive: C-1's commit and blob list, C-3's
  needles and the provisional 16, C-7's measurements, and Cloudflare's
  "roughly half" claim. Nothing is oracle-free.
- **C-9 Baseline: the vendored documents name no `docs/` path.** `grep -rn
  'docs/'` over the 20 skill files and `LICENSE` at the pinned commit: 0
  hits (PLANNED). So `shipped-docs`, which scans every `.md` under
  `.claude/skills`, has nothing new to judge there; the command is the only
  new site, and its two paths are a `ship` entry and a `/`-terminated pattern.
- **C-10 Test-only dependencies.** None. The suite needs bash, git, awk.

## Deferred verifications

- **DV-1 (first trial run sets the budget default)** — One `quick`,
  repo-wide `/security-audit` run against this repository with the
  provisional budget of 16, executed **by the orchestrating session** (the
  `feature-developer` subagent cannot spawn the hunters; this is the one DV
  the orchestrator runs itself, between the GATES dispatch and the gate run).
  It cannot run before GATES because until GREEN there is no command and no
  vendored skill. Record here, as a block: agent invocations spent by phase
  (reconnaissance / hunters / critic / verifiers), wall-clock, findings by
  verdict (`confirmed` / `needs_validation` / `rejected`, and "nothing found
  this run" if none confirmed), the validator status line the summary
  carried (C-7 predicts `validators not run: Failed to read findings JSON:
  OS no-follow and nonblocking input protection is unavailable`), the
  resolved model of the parent and of each dispatch by name, the path of the
  summary written, and the stories filed. Then set the budget default in the
  command from it - the number spent, rounded up to leave one reserve verifier
  - and drop the "provisional" clause. The AC-2 regex accepts any whole
  number, so the edit changes no test. A run that the budget cannot fund
  (Cloudflare's `budget_cannot_fund_reconnaissance_and_reserves`) is a
  result too: record it, raise the number, run once more. Owner: GATES

  **Result (GATES, 2026-10-08, run by the orchestrating session on fable):**

  candidate at 16 would have made the run `incomplete`. AC-2's regex accepts the
  new number; no test changed. One adaptation of the skill is recorded in the
  summary's Evidence: agents were pointed at the exact files and section names
  to read rather than having the blocks pasted into every prompt.

- **DV-2 (defect put back: a vendored file altered)** — With the first line
  of `.claude/skills/security-audit/LICENSE` deleted, AC-1's real-tree
  assertion MUST go red in the `security-audit` suite with exactly one line
  naming `LICENSE`, and nothing else in the suite may move. RED cannot run it:
  there is no vendored tree to mutate. Through `scripts/mutate.sh`, against
  the one suite:

      bash scripts/mutate.sh .claude/skills/security-audit/LICENSE '1d' -- bash scripts/selftest.sh security-audit

  Paste the red and the `restored (verified byte-for-byte ...)` line.
  Owner: GATES

  **Result (GATES, 2026-10-08, run by the orchestrator on fable):** red as
  predicted, in exactly two assertions, both naming `LICENSE` — the real tree
  and the AC-4 refreshed copy, which the handoff said would move together
  because the refresh copies the mutated working tree. Nothing else moved.

## Amendments

<!-- Acceptance criteria are frozen once the story leaves PLANNED. If one turns
     out to be wrong or unsatisfiable, stop, put it to the product owner, and
     record the change here. Omit the section if unused. -->

## Model guidance

Planned by `bash scripts/plan.sh write HARNESS-043` from `.claude/harness/models.conf`.
A PLAN, not a record: a session setting or an explicit override can beat both
this and the agent's own `model:` field, and nothing here can see which won.
The orchestrator still writes down the model each dispatch **resolved** to, by
name, below the table.

| Phase | Agent | Planned | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| PLANNED | `lead-po` | `fable` | planning is the judgement phase - decomposition, the oracle partition, the contract - and planning is what fable is judged best at |
| RED | `test-developer` | `opus` | writing the failing tests, the negative controls and the handoff is development work, and opus is judged the stronger model for it |
| GREEN | `feature-developer` | `opus` | the failure mode of a weaker model here is reaching green by weakening a test, which is the one thing this harness exists to prevent |
| GATES | `feature-developer` | `opus` | same risk as GREEN, and a gate failure is where "make it stop complaining" is most tempting |
| REVIEW | `lead-po` | `fable` | reading review feedback against the contract is orchestration judgement, and a wrong call here ships; a fix it finds goes back to GATES or RED, on opus |
| SCAFFOLD | `lead-po` | `opus` | source, tests and config in one indivisible derivation - code, with no failing test in front of any of it, so the stronger development model |

**Resolved:**

- PLANNED - `lead-po` - resolved `fable` (reported by the agent; no override in the dispatch). As planned.
- RED - `test-developer` - resolved `opus` (reported by the agent; no override in the dispatch). As planned.
- GREEN - `feature-developer` - resolved `opus` (reported by the agent; no override in the dispatch). As planned.
- GATES - orchestrating session (DV-1 run as the skill's parent) - resolved `fable`; every hunter/critic/verifier dispatch `model: opus` as the command says, none reported an override. No feature-developer dispatch: all gates unconfigured, nothing to fix.

<!-- One line per dispatch, as it happened: phase, agent, the model that
     actually ran, and — if a phase was planned for one model and ran on
     another — what that changed. A choice with no verdict is folklore. -->
## Out of scope

- Editing any of Cloudflare's 20 skill files or `LICENSE` - including making the
  validators work on Windows (C-7). Updating is a re-copy plus a regenerated
  `UPSTREAM`; a harness-side fix goes upstream as a PR, never into the copy.
- Vendoring upstream's `README.md`.
- Making `/security-audit` a gate, putting it in `project.conf`, running it
  from `/advance-story`, `/complete-story` or `plan.sh after`, or having
  anything run it other than the user typing it.
- `standard` or `deep` as the default profile. Both remain available by
  asking; only the default is decided here.
- Fixing, mitigating or triaging any finding the trial run produces. Findings
  become `fix` stories through `new-story.sh` and go through RED→GREEN like
  anything else. DV-1 files them; nothing here acts on them.
- Providing, emulating or documenting a sandbox. The command states there is
  none; building one is a different story.
- A new agent definition under `.claude/agents/` for hunters or verifiers
  (C-6), and any change to `.claude/harness/models.conf`.
- Running it against downstream projects (fantasy-world-builder,
  manga-translator). They receive the command and the skill on their next
  `refresh-harness.sh` and run it themselves.
- A `doctor.sh` row for `node`. The command checks `command -v node` at run
  time and reports; the environment page is `/setup-environment`'s.
- Any change to `scripts/refresh-harness.sh`: the skill directory lands
  through the existing `.claude/skills` replace (AC-4 proves it; it does not
  build it).

## Design notes

<!-- Omitted: no user interface. -->

## Test plan

<!-- Filled by the Test Developer during RED: which tests, at which level,
     and which AC each one covers. -->

All four criteria are mechanical (C-8), so every test is a static check of a
file or a tree, run as a harness suite; the one integration-level case is
AC-4, which runs the real `scripts/refresh-harness.sh` into a fixture project.
Each rule runs over the real tree (must print nothing) and over fixtures built
compliant by construction with exactly one defect (must print exactly the one
line naming it) - the second is what makes the first mean anything.

**New suite `.claude/tests/security-audit.test.sh`** (`bash scripts/selftest.sh security-audit`):

- **AC-1, the rule** (`vendor_problems <dir>`, `vendor_listed <dir>`), 12
  fixture assertions: compliant fixture silent; listing parsed (4 lines);
  one byte changed in `SKILL.md` -> one line naming it; `LICENSE` emptied ->
  one line naming it; extra file -> one line; extra file one directory down
  -> one line; listed file deleted -> one line; no `UPSTREAM` -> one line
  (not one per file); first line naming another repo; first line with a
  39-hex commit; a one-space listing line (exact two-line output: malformed,
  then the file it meant is unlisted); missing directory -> one line.
- **AC-1, the real tree**, 3 assertions: `vendor_problems` over
  `.claude/skills/security-audit` prints nothing; `UPSTREAM`'s first line is
  exactly C-2's; the listing, sorted, is exactly C-1's 21 `<sha>  <path>`
  pairs, held in the suite as settled data. The third is how "pinned to
  C-1's commit" is enforced: `vendor_problems` alone only checks that the
  directory agrees with its own `UPSTREAM`, so a GREEN that vendored a
  different commit with a self-consistent `UPSTREAM` would satisfy it. The
  comparison is of the **set** (both sides sorted), so GREEN may order the
  lines as it likes; C-1's order is the natural one.
- **AC-2, the rule** (`command_problems <file>`), 27 fixture assertions: the
  all-needles fixture is silent; the needle table has 18 rows; **each of the
  18 needles removed in turn** prints exactly the one line naming it (a loop,
  one assertion per needle); the budget at 23 with no provisional clause
  passes (DV-1's edit); a non-numeric budget, a non-repo-wide scope and a
  non-`quick` profile are each reported; the next-action needle moved to an
  earlier paragraph is reported as missing from the last; a closing paragraph
  added after both last-paragraph needles reports both (trailing blank lines
  ignored); a missing file is one line.
- **AC-2, the real tree**, 1 assertion: `command_problems` over
  `.claude/commands/security-audit.md` prints nothing.
- **AC-4, control**, 4 assertions: a refresh from a stand-in upstream with no
  security-audit (not even a git repo) exits 0, delivers the skill it does
  hold, and leaves the project with neither the skill directory nor the
  command.
- **AC-4, this checkout**, 4 assertions: the refresh from `$REPO_ROOT` exits 0;
  the project's command is byte-identical to this checkout's; `vendor_problems`
  over the project's copy prints nothing; its listing is still C-1's 21.

**AC-3, existing suites:** one row `security-audit|bash scripts/plan.sh after`
in `reporting.test.sh`'s `NEXT_TABLE` (C-5). `shipped-docs` needs no edit:
C-9 measured the vendored files name no `docs/` path, and the command's two
are a `ship` entry and a `/`-terminated pattern.

**Not tested, deliberately:** the executable bit on the two validators (C-1:
the pin checks content, not mode); anything about the LOCAL report the
refresh prints (it only prints, and differs between a full clone and a CI
checkout); the semantics behind the needles (C-3's "Semantics" bullets are
prose a model follows, not something a static check can see - the same limit
`reporting.test.sh` states for itself). DV-1 is the trial run that exercises
them.

## Handoff: RED -> GREEN

<!-- Filled by the Test Developer at the end of RED. This is the ONLY channel
     to the Feature Developer, whose context is fresh. Must contain:
       * the exact command that runs the new tests
       * the failure output, and why it is the RIGHT failure
       * every file touched, and which AC each test covers
       * the EXPORT SHAPE the tests already pin
       * any test that passed on arrival, and the probe or negative control
         that earns it
       * anything discovered that changes the approach -->

      AC-4 control: an upstream without the skill does not grow one

      AC-4 the refresh from this checkout delivers the command and the skill
        FAIL the project now has .claude/commands/security-audit.md, byte-identical to this checkout's
             project copy: absent; this checkout's: absent
        FAIL and vendor_problems over the project's copy of the skill prints nothing
             expected: 
             actual:   ./: directory does not exist

             actual:   

    security-audit: 44 passed, 7 failed
    FAIL security-audit  did 44 units of work, below the floor of 51 in .claude/tests/floors.conf

**Why it is the right failure.** Every one of the 7 is a real-tree assertion,
and each fails on the named absence and nothing else: the directory and the
command do not exist, in this checkout and therefore in the refreshed
project. The suite loads and runs to the end - this is not an import-style
dark RED: all 44 fixture and control assertions executed and passed, so the
two rules are observed working before GREEN writes a byte. The real refresh
itself already exits 0; only what it delivers is missing.

    $ bash scripts/selftest.sh reporting
        FAIL reporting_problems over the real tree prints nothing: every site that speaks to the user carries the reporting rule
             expected: 
             actual:   .claude/commands/security-audit.md: is in the next-action table but does not exist
    reporting: 26 passed, 1 failed
    FAIL reporting  did 26 units of work, below the floor of 27 in .claude/tests/floors.conf

That is AC-3's control, with exactly the wording AC-3 quotes (the suite's
`printf` at `reporting.test.sh:275`). The row adds no assertion, so the
floor stays 27.

    $ bash scripts/selftest.sh shipped-docs
    shipped-docs: 14 passed, 0 failed

    $ bash scripts/selftest.sh selftest
    selftest: 268 passed, 0 failed
    assertion floors: all 1 suite(s) met their declared floor (268 assertions executed, 268 declared).

**Files touched.**

| File | Change | AC |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/tests/security-audit.test.sh` | new suite, 51 executed assertions | AC-1, AC-2, AC-4 |
| `.claude/tests/reporting.test.sh` | one `NEXT_TABLE` row, `security-audit\|bash scripts/plan.sh after`, after `audit-mutations` | AC-3 |
| `.claude/tests/floors.conf` | `floor \| security-audit \| 51`, and a HARNESS-043 note at the foot | - |
| `.claude/tests/selftest.test.sh` | `security-audit 51` in the hand-copied table (`:549`) | - |
| this story | C-3 and C-4 amended in place (below), `## Test plan`, this handoff | - |

**Contract amendments made in RED (read them in the Contract).**

1. **C-3: the Defaults line is one ERE**,
   ``Defaults: scope repo-wide; profile `quick`; budget [0-9]+ agent invocations \(strict``,
   not the bare budget regex - otherwise AC-2's default scope and default
   profile have no needle. C-3's literal line satisfies it; write it byte
   for byte.
2. **C-4: the refresh copies the working tree.** `refresh-harness.sh:379-384`
   is `rm -rf` + `cp -r "$UP/.claude/$d"`, and the AC-4 control proves it:
   its upstream is not a git repository and its skill still arrives. **GREEN
   does not have to commit for AC-4 to pass.**

**What GREEN must satisfy - the shape the tests pin, stated as fact.**

- `.claude/skills/security-audit/UPSTREAM`: line 1 exactly
  `# cloudflare/security-audit-skill @ c1c8a8c1471069fb0e188eeaff69b8e8db6564a8 (2026-09-14, MIT) - git blob SHAs; verify with `git hash-object``
  (C-2, compared whole-line). Then the 21 lines of C-1 with
  `skills/security-audit/` dropped, `<40 lowercase hex>` + **two spaces** +
  `<path>`, any order. Further `#` lines and blank lines are tolerated; any
  other line not of that shape is reported.
- Exactly those 21 files in the directory, at the top level, with exactly
  those blobs as `git hash-object <path>` computes them from inside the
  directory (so `.gitattributes` applies). **Nothing else** in the directory
  but `UPSTREAM` - no README, no `.gitkeep`, no notes file; anything else is
  `<path>: not listed in UPSTREAM`.
- `.claude/commands/security-audit.md`: all 18 needles of C-3, each **within
  one line** (do not wrap a needle across lines; markdown will want to). 15
  fixed strings anywhere in the file (the three frontmatter lines included -
  the test does not require them to be inside the `---` block, but they
  belong there); the Defaults ERE above anywhere; and
  ``Report as `rules.md`, "Reporting to the user" says`` and
  `bash scripts/plan.sh after` both in the **last paragraph** (the lines
  after the last blank line, trailing blank lines ignored). Nothing may
  follow that paragraph but blank lines.
- `shipped-docs` must stay green: write the summary path as
  `docs/wiki/audits/<scope>-<date>.md` (C-3, "Spelling"), and name no other
  `docs/` path that `docs-shipped.conf` does not cover.
- **Not constrained:** the order of `UPSTREAM`'s listing lines, any comment
  lines after the first, the executable bit, every word of the command
  outside the needles, where in the body each needle sits.

**Fixture controls, observed now** (they test the two rules themselves, so
they run and pass in RED; none is a threshold, each asserts an exact string):

| Control | Expected output | Observed in RED |
|---|---|---|
| compliant vendor fixture | (nothing) | nothing - pass |
| one byte of `SKILL.md` changed | `SKILL.md: blob <new> does not match UPSTREAM's <old>` | exactly that - pass |
| `LICENSE` emptied | `LICENSE: blob e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391 does not match UPSTREAM's <old>` | exactly that - pass |
| extra `NOTES.md` | `NOTES.md: not listed in UPSTREAM` | pass |
| extra `reference/extra.md` | `reference/extra.md: not listed in UPSTREAM` | pass |
| listed `HUNTING.md` deleted | `HUNTING.md: listed in UPSTREAM but does not exist` | pass |
| no `UPSTREAM` | `UPSTREAM: file is missing` (one line) | pass |
| first line names another repo / a 39-hex commit | `UPSTREAM: first line does not name cloudflare/security-audit-skill and a 40-hex commit` | pass, both |
| a one-space listing line | that line reported, then `HUNTING.md: not listed in UPSTREAM` | pass |
| all 18 needles present | (nothing) | pass |
| each needle removed, 18 cases | exactly the one line naming it | 18 of 18 pass |
| budget `23`, no provisional clause | (nothing) | pass |
| budget `sixteen` / scope not repo-wide / profile `standard` | `security-audit.md: has no line matching /<the Defaults ERE>/` | pass, all three |
| next-action needle only in an earlier paragraph | one `its last paragraph does not carry` line | pass |
| a paragraph after both last-paragraph needles | two such lines | pass |
| refresh from an upstream without the skill | exit 0, its own skill delivered, no security-audit dir, no command | pass, all four |

**Passed on arrival against the real tree:** one assertion, "the refresh
from this checkout exits 0". It is a precondition of AC-4 rather than AC-4
itself - the AC-4 assertions are the three after it, all red - and it is
earned by the control above it: the same script, the same fixture project,
and there the delivered/not-delivered assertions do discriminate.

**Guard against a vacuous "prints nothing".** Both rules return 0 always, so
the exit status says nothing; what stops a broken rule passing the real-tree
checks is that the same function, in the same run, prints the exact expected
line for every fixture defect above. A `vendor_problems` that silently read
an empty listing is caught twice more: the fixture asserts `vendor_listed`
returns 4 lines, and the real tree asserts it returns C-1's 21.

**Deferred verifications.** DV-1 and DV-2 are GATES-owned and could not run in
RED: there is no vendored tree to mutate and no command to run. I did not run
either. DV-2's command in the story targets the right suite, and the
assertion it should turn red is "vendor_problems over the real directory
prints nothing", with exactly `LICENSE: blob <sha> does not match UPSTREAM's
6dbc9ecb3a5b9080e95b962869e8c7ab16cfdc20`; note the AC-4 assertion "vendor_problems
over the project's copy" will go red with it too, since the refresh copies the
mutated working tree - so "nothing else in the suite may move" will see **two**
red assertions, both naming `LICENSE`, plus the floor line. That is expected,
not a second defect; GATES should record it as such rather than read DV-2 as
failed.

**Timings** (all local, Windows 11, Git Bash; none from CI): the suite took
15 s through `selftest.sh` after removing per-needle forks from
`command_problems` (33 s before); one refresh from this checkout is ~3 s.
Neither suite has a timeout to budget.

**`gates.sh --fast`:** every gate `UNCONFIGURED` (format, lint, typecheck,
unit, coverage), mutation ON REQUEST, "All required gates passed (0 ran, 5
unconfigured, 0 known)"; it notes `security-audit.test.sh` is untracked -
stage it with the commit. `check-sigpipe.sh` and `check-grep-count.sh` over
the new suite: 0 findings each. `lib` (which greps every suite for
portability): `247 passed, 0 failed`.

**GATES → REVIEW (2026-10-08, orchestrator on fable).** Full self-test, run
detached while the story was at GATES, nothing else running in this worktree:

    $ bash scripts/selftest.sh

81 minutes, against about 25 for GREEN's run of the same suites on this host.
It passed. `ps` afterwards shows no orphaned self-test or gate run. The cause

  https://github.com/cloudflare/security-audit-skill
  c1c8a8c1471069fb0e188eeaff69b8e8db6564a8` into an empty scratch repository
  (with `core.autocrlf=false`); `git ls-tree -r FETCH_HEAD` matched C-1 line
  for line (plus upstream's `README.md`, skipped). Each blob was written with
  `git cat-file blob <sha>` (raw bytes, no filters) flat into
  `.claude/skills/security-audit/`, `skills/security-audit/` dropped.
  `UPSTREAM` was generated from the same `ls-tree` by awk, C-2's first line
  prepended - no SHA hand-typed. Validators staged `100755` with
  `git update-index --chmod=+x`.
- *Hash verification.* `git hash-object <path>` from inside the directory
  against every `UPSTREAM` line: 21 of 21 `ok`, 0 mismatches. The staged
  index blobs (`git ls-files -s`) are the same 21 SHAs, so `.gitattributes`
  normalisation changed nothing on add.
- *Command.* `.claude/commands/security-audit.md`, 54 lines, every C-3 needle
  on one line, the Defaults line exactly C-3's literal; the summary path
  spelled `docs/wiki/audits/<scope>-<date>.md` and no other `docs/` path but
  `TEMPLATE.md`.
- *Results.*

      $ bash scripts/selftest.sh security-audit
      security-audit: 51 passed, 0 failed
      assertion floors: all 1 suite(s) met their declared floor (51 assertions executed, 51 declared).
      $ bash scripts/selftest.sh reporting
      reporting: 27 passed, 0 failed
      $ bash scripts/selftest.sh shipped-docs
      shipped-docs: 14 passed, 0 failed
      $ bash scripts/check-sigpipe.sh
      check-sigpipe: scanned 49 shell file(s), 45 with pipefail, 0 finding(s)
      $ bash scripts/check-grep-count.sh
      check-grep-count: scanned 49 shell file(s), 0 finding(s)
      $ bash scripts/gates.sh --fast
      All required gates passed (0 ran, 5 unconfigured, 0 known).
      $ bash scripts/selftest.sh            # every suite, ~25 min here
      assertion floors: all 26 suite(s) met their declared floor (2993 assertions executed, 2702 declared).
      26 harness suite(s) passed.

- *Controls.* Every control in the handoff table is a fixture built by the
  suite itself, so nothing GREEN wrote is an input to any of them; all ran
  and passed again (51 of 51), with the same expected strings. No divergence
  from RED to report. The one real-tree precondition ("the refresh from this
  checkout exits 0") still passes, and the three AC-4 assertions after it
  that were red in RED are now green.

**PLANNED → RED checks (orchestrator on fable, 2026-10-07, against `5c200f3`).**

- *Count corrected before leaving PLANNED.* AC-1, C-1, C-9 and Out of scope
  said "21 skill files" / "22 files"; C-1's own listing has 21 entries, 20
  under `skills/security-audit/` plus `LICENSE`. Upstream's 22 blobs include
  `README.md`, which is not vendored. Corrected in place and committed at
  PLANNED, so no `## Amendments` entry is owed.
- *Line endings cannot move a blob SHA.* `.gitattributes` sets `* text=auto
  eol=lf` and this host has `core.autocrlf=true`, so a vendored file containing
  CR would be normalised on commit and its blob would stop matching upstream's.
  Measured: none of the 21 upstream files at `c1c8a8c` contains a `\r` (raw
  bytes via the GitHub contents API, `tr -cd '\r' | wc -c` = 0 for each). And a
  CRLF file written under `.claude/skills/` hashes, through `git hash-object
  <path>`, to the same SHA as its LF form (filters apply), so AC-1's check is
  stable across checkouts.
- *Gate.* `gates.sh --list`: every gate in this repository is
  `<unconfigured>`; the binding check is `selftest.sh` in CI, as Context says.
  `required_gates: []` stays.
- *Callers:* none (no signature changes). *Epic:* none.

**PLANNED (2026-10-07, Lead PO on fable, dispatched with no override).**

- Upstream fetched into an empty repository with `git fetch --depth 1
  https://github.com/cloudflare/security-audit-skill
  c1c8a8c1471069fb0e188eeaff69b8e8db6564a8`; `git ls-tree -r FETCH_HEAD` is
  C-1. The release tarball of the same commit matched 22 of 22 blobs by
  `git hash-object`. GREEN may take the files from either; the SHAs decide.
- Once vendored, `security-audit` appears in every session's skill list with
  Cloudflare's own description, and its *guidance mode* (answering a
  security question without a run) is reachable by loading the skill
  directly. That is Cloudflare's design and is untouched; `/security-audit`
  is the harness's entry to *full audit mode* only.
- `.claude/harness/VERSION` is bumped in the DONE commit, as HARNESS-042 did
  (release 87), not in `touches:`.
- DV-1 is the orchestrator's own run, on the session's model, and will take
  real wall-clock: up to 16 `opus` agents plus a fable parent. Budget an hour
  for the GATES phase and say so when reporting.
- `bash scripts/plan.sh conflicts` has nothing to compare against: the
  board holds no other open story. `touches:` is filled anyway, with globs
  only for the two real families (`*.md`, `*.cjs`) the vendored copy edits as
  one.
