## Context

Observed 2026-10-10, Claude Code CLI v2.1.293, started interactively in
`D:\agentic-dev-harness`. At startup the CLI printed, about
`.claude/settings.json`'s `permissions.deny`:

    Permission deny rule "MultiEdit(./.claude/state/current-story.env)" matches no known tool — check for typos.
    Permission deny rule "MultiEdit(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)" matches no known tool — check for typos.
    Permission deny rule (.claude\settings.json): Write(./.claude/state/current-story.env) is not matched by file permission checks — only Edit(path) rules are. Use Edit(./.claude/state/current-story.env) instead (Edit rules cover all file-editing tools).
    Permission deny rule (.claude\settings.json): MultiEdit(./.claude/state/current-story.env) is not matched by file permission checks — only Edit(path) rules are. Use Edit(./.claude/state/current-story.env) instead (Edit rules cover all file-editing tools).
    Permission deny rule (.claude\settings.json): Write(./.claude/state/last-gate-run) is not matched by file permission checks — only Edit(path) rules are. Use Edit(./.claude/state/last-gate-run) instead (Edit rules cover all file-editing tools).
    Permission deny rule (.claude\settings.json): MultiEdit(./.claude/state/last-gate-run) is not matched by file permission checks — only Edit(path) rules are. Use Edit(./.claude/state/last-gate-run) instead (Edit rules cover all file-editing tools).

So, per the runtime, of the six state-file deny rules only the two `Edit(...)`
rules do anything. The `Write(...)` and `MultiEdit(...)` rules are discarded,
and an `Edit(path)` rule is matched against every file-editing tool. The
harness believes the opposite in four places, each confirmed by reading at
PLANNED:

- `.claude/settings.json` lists `Write`, `Edit` and `MultiEdit` deny rules for
  `./.claude/state/current-story.env` and `./.claude/state/last-gate-run`.
- `.claude/state/README.md`, "The `Hand-editable` column is enforced", says
  settings.json denies `Write`, `Edit` and `MultiEdit` on the `no` rows and
  that the suite's `TOOLS` list drives both directions of the check.
- `.claude/tests/settings.test.sh` has `TOOLS="Write Edit MultiEdit"`, which
  makes every `no` row **demand** a rule per tool. The suite therefore
  requires the dead rules and goes red if they are removed. It was green
  while requiring rules the runtime discards: a rule probed only against
  fixtures its author wrote, which `rules.md` ("A rule is probed against the
  tree it judges") names as the failure.
- `.claude/harness/rules.md`, Non-negotiables, the `.claude/state/**` bullet,
  says the two files are "denied to `Write`, `Edit` and `MultiEdit` in
  `settings.json`".

`docs/wiki/audits/state-deny-2026-09-10.md` records why the `MultiEdit` rules
went in ("a missing rule on a build that has the tool is a hole") and says
twice that whether a `MultiEdit(...)` deny is enforced was never probed. The
warning answers that: it is not, because the runtime never matches it. The
audit stays as the dated record it is; this story adds one dated update to it.

**What this is not.** It is not a known protection gap. The two `Edit` rules
are in place and, per the warning text, cover `Write` and `MultiEdit` too.
Nobody has confirmed that by observation, and the claim comes from the CLI's
own message rather than from anything this repository has run, so the story
does not assert it: DV-2 (Owner: REVIEW) observes it in a throwaway session
and records what happened. The harm the story removes is that the suite
enforces rules the runtime discards, and the docs teach a wrong model of how
permissions work, which a consumer copying the pattern would carry into its
own `settings.json`.

**Why after HARNESS-047.** HARNESS-047 edits the same `deny` array (appending
`Bash(git log *--output*)` and `Bash(git diff *--output*)`) and the same suite
(`git_output_rules`), and its Contract C-1 places its two lines "after the
`MultiEdit(...)` entries, as the last two elements". That position is prose,
not an assertion - its checker matches each line anchored wherever it is -
but two stories editing one array in two worktrees would collide on every
line. `depends_on: [HARNESS-047]`; this story starts once 047 is DONE and
keeps 047's two lines as the last two elements.

Required gate that fails if this story's artifact broke: `selftest`, through
`.claude/tests/settings.test.sh` (`bash scripts/selftest.sh settings`).

## Acceptance criteria

<!-- Each AC is independently testable and phrased as observable behaviour.
     The Test Developer writes at least one failing test per AC. -->

- **AC-1 (settings.json carries Edit rules only)** - Given the live
  `.claude/settings.json`, when its `deny` array is read, then for each of
  `current-story.env` and `last-gate-run` it holds exactly one rule naming
  that path, `Edit(./.claude/state/<file>)`; no `Write(...)`, `MultiEdit(...)`
  or `NotebookEdit(...)` rule names any path under `./.claude/state/`; the
  three `Read(...)` denies and HARNESS-047's two `Bash(git … *--output*)`
  denies are unchanged, the Bash pair still the last two elements; and the
  file is valid JSON.
- **AC-2 (a `no` row demands its Edit rule, and only that)** - Given a
  settings/README pair in which the README lists `last-gate-run` as
  hand-editable `no` and the settings file has no
  `Edit(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)` rule, when `problems` runs, then it
  prints exactly one line,
  `last-gate-run: not hand-editable, but settings.json has no "Edit(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)"`,
  and nothing else; and given the baseline pair with both `Edit` rules and no
  other state rule, it prints nothing.
- **AC-3 (a dead rule is a complaint)** - Given the baseline pair plus one
  rule `Write(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)`, when `problems` runs, then it
  prints exactly one line,
  `"Write(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)" is dead: only Edit(path) rules are matched by file permission checks`,
  and nothing else. The same holds for `MultiEdit(./.claude/state/current-story.env)`
  and for `NotebookEdit(./.claude/state/current-story.env)`, each with its own
  rule text in the line. A dead rule complains whether or not the README lists
  its path (a dead rule on `gate-logs/*.log`, a `yes` row, prints the dead-rule
  line and nothing about the row), so removing a dead rule is never reported
  as dropping protection.
- **AC-4 (the backwards check reads Edit rules)** - Given the baseline pair
  plus `Edit(./.claude/state/**)`, when `problems` runs, then it prints
  `denied path '**' is not in the README table`; plus
  `Edit(./.claude/state/gate-logs/*.log)` it prints
  `gate-logs/*.log: hand-editable, but settings.json denies it with "Edit(./.claude/state/gate-logs/*.log)"`;
  plus `Edit(./.claude/state/mystery)` it prints
  `denied path 'mystery' is not in the README table`; and a settings file
  with no `Edit(./.claude/state/…)` rule at all prints
  `settings.json denies nothing under .claude/state/` and one
  `not hand-editable, but settings.json has no "Edit(…)"` line per `no` row.
- **AC-5 (the documents say Edit, and name no tool list)** - Given
  `.claude/state/README.md` and `.claude/harness/rules.md`, when the suite
  reads them, then the README's section headed
  `## The \`Hand-editable\` column is enforced` contains the sentence
  `An \`Edit(path)\` rule is the only file deny rule the runtime matches, and it covers every file-editing tool.`
  on one line, and neither that section nor the `.claude/state/**` bullet of
  `rules.md` (the Non-negotiables bullet beginning `Do not commit
  \`.claude/state/**\``) contains the string `TOOLS`, `Write(`, `MultiEdit(`
  or `Write, Edit`.
- **AC-6 (the suite has no tool list)** - Given `.claude/tests/settings.test.sh`,
  when it is read, then it defines no variable named `TOOLS`, and
  `bash scripts/selftest.sh settings` passes on the live pair with at least
  27 assertions executed (the declared floor; never lowered).

Oracle partition: every criterion is **mechanical** (Contract C-6).

## Contract

<!-- Written by the Lead PO BEFORE RED, and AMENDABLE BY RED IN PLACE with a
     reason - GREEN then builds what the amended block says. -->

**Writes:** `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/tests/settings.test.sh`, `.claude/state/README.md`, `.claude/harness/rules.md`, `docs/wiki/audits/state-deny-2026-09-10.md`

All five classify as `harness` or `docs` (`bash scripts/classify.sh` at
PLANNED), so the phase lock freezes none of them; the role boundary is
honoured by the agents. RED writes `settings.test.sh` only. GREEN writes
`settings.json`, `.claude/state/README.md` and `.claude/harness/rules.md`.
The audit update is the orchestrator's, written at GATES. No existing export
changes signature; `problems <settings> <readme>` keeps its name, arguments
and "one line per disagreement, silence means agreement" shape, so there is
no caller list.

**RED may amend any block below in place, with a reason; GREEN builds what
the amended block says.**

- **C-1 The deny array (settled - read out, never re-derived).** After GREEN,
  `.claude/settings.json`'s `deny` array is, in order and byte for byte:

      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)",
      "Read(./**/secrets/**)",
      "Edit(./.claude/state/current-story.env)",
      "Edit(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)",
      "Bash(git log *--output*)",
      "Bash(git diff *--output*)"

  The four removed lines are `Write(./.claude/state/current-story.env)`,
  `MultiEdit(./.claude/state/current-story.env)`,
  `Write(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)` and
  `MultiEdit(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)`. Nothing else in the file
  changes. HARNESS-047's `git_output_rules` keeps passing because it matches
  each of its lines anchored, not by position.
- **C-2 `problems` in `settings.test.sh`.** Same signature. Three checks
  survive and one is new; `TOOLS` is deleted, together with the comment
  block that justified each tool and the `settings_for <tool>...` fixture
  generator's tool parameter (`settings_for` becomes `good_settings`, which
  writes exactly the two `Edit` rules).
  1. *Row answers yes/no* - unchanged, same complaint text.
  2. *Forwards* - for each row, `rule="\"Edit(./.claude/state/$path)\""`;
     a `no` row without it prints
     `<path>: not hand-editable, but settings.json has no "Edit(./.claude/state/<path>)"`,
     a `yes` row with it prints
     `<path>: hand-editable, but settings.json denies it with "Edit(./.claude/state/<path>)"`.
     The texts are the existing ones with the tool fixed to `Edit`; the
     fixtures assert whole output with `assert_eq`, not `assert_contains`,
     where AC-2 and AC-3 say "exactly one line".
  3. *Dead rules* (new) - every line of the settings file matching
     `"(Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit)\(\./\.claude/state/[^)]*\)"` prints
     `<rule> is dead: only Edit(path) rules are matched by file permission checks`,
     where `<rule>` is the matched text in its double quotes, e.g.
     `"Write(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)" is dead: …`. Exactly these three
     tool names: `Read(...)` and `Bash(...)` rules are matched by the runtime
     and are not the suite's business. This check runs before the backwards
     one and does not consult the README.
  4. *Backwards* - alternation is `Edit` only; complaint texts unchanged
     (`denied path '<p>' is not in the README table`,
     `denied path '<p>' is listed as hand-editable`,
     `settings.json denies nothing under .claude/state/`).
  The `describe "the two files that carry evidence stay denied"` block keeps
  its independence from the README and asserts the two `Edit` rules only.
  The three `TOOLS`-override cases and `an undocumented path under a later
  tool` are deleted; AC-3's cases replace them. The suite's header comment
  (the two paragraphs about `MultiEdit` and the "Verified separately by probe"
  paragraph) is rewritten to say what the runtime does: `Edit(path)` is the
  only file deny rule matched, it covers every file-editing tool, and the
  observation that backs that is DV-2 of this story.
- **C-3 The documents.** `.claude/state/README.md`, section "The
  `Hand-editable` column is enforced": the first paragraph says settings.json
  denies `Edit` on exactly the `no` rows and that the suite checks the two
  directions; the `TOOLS` paragraph is replaced by one that contains, on one
  line, the sentence AC-5 pins, followed by: the runtime prints a startup
  warning for a `Write(path)` or `MultiEdit(path)` rule and discards it, so
  the suite reports such a rule as dead rather than demanding it; and
  `NotebookEdit` needs no mention beyond "covered by the Edit rule". The
  "Verified by probe" paragraph (Bash append and `rm` refused) stands; it was
  observed, and this story does not contradict it. `rules.md`'s
  `.claude/state/**` bullet: "denied to `Write`, `Edit` and `MultiEdit`"
  becomes "denied to `Edit` in `settings.json` - the one file deny rule the
  runtime matches, and it covers `Write` and `MultiEdit` too"; the rest of
  the bullet is unchanged. `docs/wiki/audits/state-deny-2026-09-10.md` gains
  a dated section `## Update, 2026-10-10: the MultiEdit and Write rules were never matched`
  of a few lines: the warning text, that HARNESS-050 removed them, and that
  the probe the audit said it could not run is answered by DV-2 of this
  story. Nothing above it is edited.
- **C-4 The floor.** `.claude/tests/floors.conf` declares `settings | 27`
  (recorded again in `.claude/tests/selftest.test.sh`). This story removes
  assertions (`stay denied` 6 to 2, the three `TOOLS` cases, the later-tool
  case) and adds AC-3's, AC-4's and AC-5's. RED keeps the executed count at
  27 or above - each AC-3 case gets a control that the same fixture with the
  rule written as `Edit(...)` prints nothing - so the floor is **not
  lowered**. If the count rises, raising the floor is optional and goes in
  both files in the same commit, or in neither.
- **C-5 Why no mutation touches the live `settings.json`.** The runtime reads
  `settings.json` live (`state-deny-2026-09-10.md`; HARNESS-047 C-3), so a
  mutation of the real file mid-session changes the rules the session runs
  under. DV-1 therefore runs `problems` over a **copy** of the live file with
  one line put back, taken with `cp` into the gitignored `.claude/state/`
  directory, and reaches it by mutating the suite's `SETTINGS=` line through
  `scripts/mutate.sh`. The copy is the real tree plus one line, not a
  hand-written fixture, which is what `rules.md` asks of a rule's probe.
- **C-6 Oracle partition.** Every criterion is **mechanical**: exact rule
  text, exact complaint lines, exact sentences. Nothing is invented or
  calibrated. The deny array (C-1), the complaint texts (C-2) and the README
  sentence (AC-5) are **settled**; RED reads them out.
- **C-7 Test-only dependencies.** None. Bash, awk, grep, sed only
  (`rules.md`, "Portability"); no JSON parser.

## Deferred verifications

- **DV-1 - defect put back (the story's central claim). Owner: GATES.**
  Condition: with `"Write(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)",` re-added to a
  copy of the committed `.claude/settings.json`, the suite **must** fail
  `the shipped pair agrees with itself` with the dead-rule line for that rule
  and nothing else; and with `"Edit(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)",`
  removed from a second copy, it **must** fail the same assertion with
  `last-gate-run: not hand-editable, but settings.json has no "Edit(./.claude/state/last-gate-run)"`
  and fail `Edit(./.claude/state/last-gate-run) is denied`. RED cannot run
  this: the dead-rule check does not exist yet, and the live file still holds
  the rule. Run each as
  `bash scripts/mutate.sh .claude/tests/settings.test.sh 's|^SETTINGS=.*|SETTINGS="$REPO_ROOT/.claude/state/dv1-<a|b>.json"|' -- bash scripts/selftest.sh settings`
  after writing the two copies, confirm the suite is green again on the
  restored file, and paste the output here.
- **DV-2 - the runtime claim behind the fix. Owner: REVIEW.** Condition: in
  a throwaway, logged-in, interactive Claude Code session started in a
  checkout of this story's branch at the PR head (so `.claude/settings.json`
  holds the two `Edit` rules only), (a) the startup output contains no line
  beginning `Permission deny rule`; (b) asked to use the `Write` tool to
  write one line to `.claude/state/last-gate-run`, the agent's attempt is
  refused by the permission system; (c) if the build offers `MultiEdit`,
  the same for it; if it does not, say so. Record the exact refusal text, or
  that the write went through, and `git status` afterwards. If (b) is NOT
  refused, the warning text was wrong, the `Write` rule was doing work, and
  the story stops at REVIEW rather than merging: put it to the user with the
  observation. Nothing in this repository can run this, which is why it is
  REVIEW's.

## Amendments

<!-- Acceptance criteria are frozen once the story leaves PLANNED. Omit the
     section if unused. -->

## Model guidance

Planned by `bash scripts/plan.sh write HARNESS-050` from `.claude/harness/models.conf`.
A PLAN, not a record: a session setting or an explicit override can beat both
this and the agent's own `model:` field, and nothing here can see which won.
The orchestrator still writes down the model each dispatch **resolved** to, by
name, below the table.

| Phase | Agent | Planned | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| PLANNED | `lead-po` | `fable` | planning is the judgement phase - decomposition, the oracle partition, the contract - and planning is what fable is judged best at |
| RED | `test-developer` | `opus` | writing the failing tests, the negative controls and the handoff is development work, and opus is judged the stronger model for it |
| GREEN | `feature-developer` | `opus` | the failure mode of a weaker model here is reaching green by weakening a test, which is the one thing this harness exists to prevent |
| GATES | `feature-developer` | `opus` | same risk as GREEN, and a gate failure is where "make it stop complaining" is most tempting |
| REVIEW | `lead-po` | `fable` | reading review feedback against the contract is orchestration judgement, and a wrong call here ships; a fix it finds goes back to GATES or RED, on opus |
| SCAFFOLD | `lead-po` | `opus` | source, tests and config in one indivisible derivation - code, with no failing test in front of any of it, so the stronger development model |

**Resolved:**

<!-- One line per dispatch, as it happened: phase, agent, the model that
     actually ran, and — if a phase was planned for one model and ran on
     another — what that changed. A choice with no verdict is folklore. -->
## Out of scope

- Any change to what is protected: the two state files stay the only `no`
  rows, and no new row, rule or glob is added. The three `Read(...)` denies
  and HARNESS-047's two `Bash(...)` denies are untouched.
- Probing whether an `Edit` rule blocks a Bash append or `rm` of the path.
  The audit observed that it does; this story neither repeats nor rewrites
  that observation.
- Rewriting the audit's body. It is a dated record of what was believed on
  2026-09-10 and stays as written; the story adds one dated update below it.
- `NotebookEdit` beyond the dead-rule check: no rule for it is added, as
  before, and no probe of it is run.
- The `PreToolUse` hook matcher `Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Bash` in
  `settings.json`. Hook matchers are a different mechanism from permission
  rules; the warning says nothing about them, and the phase guard must keep
  seeing every editing tool.
- Consumers' own `settings.json` files. A consumer that copied the six-rule
  pattern gets the fix with its next refresh of `.claude/settings.json`; this
  story does not go looking.
- The `selftest`/`floors.conf` mechanism itself. C-4 says the floor is not
  lowered; nothing about how floors work changes.

## Notes

- Filed 2026-10-10 from the user's startup-warning report. `docs/backlog/epics/`
  is empty and HARNESS-047 has no epic, so `epic:` is blank.
- `bash scripts/plan.sh conflicts` at PLANNED: output recorded in the PR body.
  HARNESS-047 shares `.claude/settings.json` and
  `.claude/tests/settings.test.sh`; resolved by `depends_on`, not by running
  the two side by side.
