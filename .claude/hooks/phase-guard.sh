    # `grep -r export src > src/index.ts` writes, and so does every read-only
    # tool on the left of a redirect. What those false positives had in common

    # in the shape of a subshell. `>|` is a redirect too. And `<` ends the
    # rm/touch operand list, because `xargs touch < list` reads `list`.
    # A redirect is the FIRST rule's business and no other rule's. Every rule
    # below it takes a word off the end of its match, and none of them knew a
    # redirect could be attached to the command: `cp a b 2>/dev/null` was refused
    # on a path of `2>/dev/null`, and `rm a 2>/dev/null` on a path of `2`, since
    # that rule's character class excludes `>` and so truncates at it, leaving
    # the file descriptor behind as the candidate. Both were denials of ordinary
    # commands, and the second is the reason this is done here rather than by
    # declining candidates that contain a `>`: such a rule cures `cp` and `mv`
    # and leaves `rm` and `touch` refusing on `2`. Enumerating shapes is how this
    # defect has survived nine of them.
    #
    # So strip redirect clauses once, and let every rule after the first read the
    # stripped text. A quoted `>` is already a control character by now, so only
    # real operators match.
