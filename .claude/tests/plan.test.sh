# Tests for scripts/plan.sh - which model each phase of a story runs on, and
# which command to drive it with.
#
# Both answers used to be asked of the human every time, which is the condition
# under which they stop being answers and become habits. The model question in
# particular: `rules.md` has said since WORLD-007 that a model choice with no
# recorded verdict is folklore, and the way a choice becomes folklore is that
# nobody writes down why - so the policy lives in a file with a reason per row,
# and the plan is written INTO the story before the phase it applies to.
#
# The policy is not taste. It is the one measurement this repository has:
#   * a partitioned RED brief on the weaker model produced sharper negative
#     controls than the stronger model without one, so RED runs on the weaker
#     model WHEN THE BRIEF EXISTS, and on the stronger one when it does not;
#   * the failure mode of a weaker model in GREEN or GATES is reaching green by
#     weakening a test, which is precisely what this harness exists to prevent,
#     so those never move.
