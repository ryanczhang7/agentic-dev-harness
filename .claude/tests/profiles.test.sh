# `new-profile.md` says what a profile must contain. Nothing enforced it, and
# the drift was immediate: the round that added the `--fast` requirement left
# four of the five shipped profiles violating it, and three profiles had been
# missing the `discovery` requirement since it was written. A profile is copied
# verbatim into a real project's project.conf, so a `slow` line naming a gate
# that does not exist, or a `floor` with nothing to measure, is not a
# documentation nit - it is a manifest error that arrives pre-installed.
#
# These are the same rules `gates.sh --audit` applies to a real project.conf,
# applied to the examples that teach people how to write one.
