# Do the deny rules in .claude/settings.json still match what the state
# directory actually holds?
#
# `.claude/state/` used to be denied wholesale - `Write(./.claude/state/**)` -
# which was right about the two files that carry evidence and wrong about
# everything else in there. It also covered the two TRACKED documents, so the
# README describing the directory could not be edited by the tools it describes,
# and it covered tool exhaust, so a leftover `mutations/*.bak` - which the
# harness itself treats as a "the restore failed, go and look" signal - could not
# be cleaned up after being acted on.
#
# The rules are now per file, which is more accurate and less durable: a state
# file added later gets no protection until somebody remembers a line, and that
# is a worse failure than the one the narrowing fixed. So it is not left to
# discipline. `.claude/state/README.md` carries a `Hand-editable` column and this
# suite checks the two against each other in BOTH directions.
#
# The checks are a function over a (settings, README) PAIR rather than statements
# about the live files, for one reason: the live files are the only ones a suite
# like this is tempted to assert against, and then every assertion in it passes on
# its first run and forever, whether or not it checks anything. Mutating the real
# settings.json to earn them is not an option either - the runtime reads
# permissions and hooks live, so a suite that edits them mid-run is changing the
# rules it is running under. So `problems` takes a pair, the real pair must produce
# none, and each way of getting it wrong is a fixture that must produce a specific
# one.
#
# WHICH RULE PROTECTS A FILE. An `Edit(path)` rule is the only file deny rule
# the runtime matches, and it covers every file-editing tool - Write, Edit,
# MultiEdit and NotebookEdit alike. A `Write(path)` or `MultiEdit(path)` rule is
# not matched at all: the CLI prints a startup warning naming it ("is not matched
# by file permission checks - only Edit(path) rules are") and discards it. This
# suite used to DEMAND a Write, an Edit and a MultiEdit rule per protected file,
# so it was green while requiring two rules in three that did nothing - a rule
# probed only against fixtures its author wrote. Now each `no` row demands its
# one `Edit` rule, and a `Write`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit` rule under the state
# directory is reported as DEAD, whatever the README says about its path, so
# removing one is never mistaken for dropping protection. That the Edit rule
# really refuses the Write tool comes from the CLI's own warning text, not from
# anything this repository can run; HARNESS-050's DV-2 is the observation that
# backs it.
#
# Verified separately by probe, since the rules are enforced by the runtime and
# not by anything in this repository: a file-specific deny blocks a Bash append
# and a Bash `rm` of that exact path, not merely the file-editing tools. The
# narrowing gave up nothing on the two files that matter.
